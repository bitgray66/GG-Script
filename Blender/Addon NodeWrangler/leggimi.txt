Add a principled texture setup from the selected texture files. Select a Principled BSDF node, select Add Principled Setup from the quick access menu (or press Shift-Ctrl-T), and select texture files. It automates the process of adding Image Texture nodes, loading images, selecting the appropriate Color Space, and connecting their outputs to the Principled BSDF node.

It detects the type of textures by looking at their file names. You can edit the tags used for this matching process in the add-on preferences.
